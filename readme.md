# Ravanhatta

This repository contains an interactive web-based artefact dedicated to the **Ravanhatta**, an ancient bowed string instrument from Rajasthan. Traditionally crafted from a **coconut shell**, **bamboo**, and **natural fibers**, the Ravanhatta holds an important place in Rajasthani folk music and is often viewed as an early predecessor of the modern violin.

This project combines cultural storytelling with web-based interaction to help viewers explore the instrument in a visually engaging manner.
